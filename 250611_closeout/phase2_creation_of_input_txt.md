# Phase 2: Creation of `input.txt`

## User Prompt Digest

After the completion of Phase 1, the user provided a new, direct instruction: "Collect this prompt literally into input.txt".

## My Understanding

I understood this as a straightforward task to:
- Create a new file named `input.txt` in the root of the current working branch (`250605`).
- Write the exact string "Collect this prompt literally into input.txt" into this file.
- Commit this new file.

## Actions Taken

1.  **Formulated a plan:**
    *   Create and populate `input.txt` with the literal string.
    *   Submit `input.txt`.
2.  **Executed the plan:**
    *   Created the file `input.txt` in the root of branch `250605` and wrote the specified content into it. (Subtask completed successfully)
    *   Submitted `input.txt` to branch `250605` with a commit message reflecting its content. (Commit successful)

## Outcomes

- The file `input.txt` was successfully created in branch `250605`.
- The file contained the literal string "Collect this prompt literally into input.txt" as requested.
- The change was committed to branch `250605`.

# Phase 1: Initial Branch Creation (250605)

## User Prompt Digest

The user requested the creation of a new branch named `250605`. The request also stipulated to "Follow the defined structure of the repo."

## My Understanding

I understood this to mean:
- Create the git branch `250605`.
- Investigate the repository's structure to identify any conventions for new branches. This involved listing files and reading existing READMEs and template files (`jules_templates/`).
- Based on the templates, particularly `branch_readme_template.md` and `session_init_template.md`, I identified the need to create a branch-specific README and a session initialization log.

## Actions Taken

1.  **Listed repository files:** To understand the structure.
2.  **Read relevant files:** `readme.md`, `jules_templates/branch_readme_template.md`, `jules_templates/session_init_template.md`.
3.  **Formulated a plan:**
    *   Create and switch to branch `250605`.
    *   Create `branch_250605_readme.md` from the template, populated with branch details.
    *   Create a session log (e.g., `jules_logs/session_log_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.md`) from the template, populated with session details.
    *   Submit the changes.
4.  **Executed the plan:**
    *   Created and switched to branch `250605`. (Subtask completed successfully)
    *   Created `branch_250605_readme.md` with content:
        *   Branch Name: `250605`
        *   Purpose: "Branch created to address issue 250605."
        *   Changes: "Initial branch setup."
        *   Status: "Work in Progress."
        (Subtask completed successfully)
    *   Created `jules_logs/session_log_20250604_050515.md` (actual timestamp from session) with session details. (Subtask completed successfully)
    *   Submitted these two files to branch `250605`. (Commit successful)

## Outcomes

- Branch `250605` was successfully created and populated according to the repository's defined structure.
- A branch-specific README (`branch_250605_readme.md`) was created.
- A session log (`jules_logs/session_log_20250604_050515.md`) was created.
- All changes were committed to branch `250605`.

- Created the main repository `readme.md` file.
- The initial user prompt (above) was saved as the first entry in this log file (`jules_logs/jules_repo_log_001.md`).
- An example subproject `subproject_alpha` was created, including:
    - `subproject_alpha/readme.md`
    - `subproject_alpha/jules_logs/` directory
    - `subproject_alpha/jules_logs/subproject_alpha_log_001.md`
- The main `readme.md` was updated to list `subproject_alpha`.
- All changes were committed to the `initial-repo-setup` branch.
